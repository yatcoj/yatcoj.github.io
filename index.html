          such as Java and C#, but I am also capable of working with C, html/css, and python. I am always open to learning new languages.</p>
          <p class="center-align light">I am currently looking for a software engineer job or internship while working on personal projects such as this website. </p>

          <p class="left-align">C#, Visual Studios, WPF Forms</p>
          <p class="left-align">This was my senior project where my partner and I created what we call, PhotoDocs. It was a digital art tool that allowed
          multiple users from different machines to work on the same image in real time. Our biggest goals with this project was to implement multiple easy to use tools
           that allowed the users to modify the image in a way they wanted to, allow any number of users to connect to a lobby to work together on an image, and keep the image updated
            in real time between all users. The application was developed in C# and used WPF forms as the canvas for the images. The network connections were made using TCP connections that were managed by separate
           threads.</p>
          <h2 class="right-align">Budgeting App</h2>
          <p class="right-align">Java, Android Studio, Google Firebase</p>
          <p class="right-align">This was a project for my Software Engineering class where my group and I created an app following IEEE coding standards. This was done in order
           to create an app following a software development life cycle. This app was an android mobile app that kept track of the user's money spent. It came with visual representations of how
          the user's money was spent based on the information stored on Firebase Cloud Firestore. If I revisit this app I wish to add a feature where the user can take a picture of their receipt and have
         the data inputted that way instead of manually entering data into specified text fields.</p>

          <p class="left-align">Sep 2018 - Dec 2018</p>
          <p class="left-align">While this job experience does not have much to do with coding, I believe it was still a valuable learning experience as
            I was still able to develop interpersonal skills. This job required lots of problem solving, patience, and communication between coworkers and consumers.</p>

          <h2 class="right-align">QA Automation Co-op at MFS</h2>
          <p class="right-align">Jan 2018 - May 2018</p>
          <p class="right-align">At this Co-op I was tasked with automating manual test cases on the MFS website. I used Java, Eclipse, and selenium in order to navigate and
          check the web page for certain elements to ensure it was working as intended. The results were outputted at the end of a test showing what succeeded and what failed.
         I also tailored the results display so it was easier to identify where the tests were failing allowing for easier troubleshooting. I also optimized test cases so that they ran
        faster by checking only the important elements and replaced wait / sleep timed statements with checking to see when the page was fully loaded.</p>
